# Agent47: From Zero to Production AI Agent in 42 Days

> A software engineer's guide to building production-ready AI agents without ML knowledge

## üéØ Overview

This is a 6-week intensive program to master AI agent development through practical engineering. You'll build real agents that solve actual problems, focusing on software architecture, system design, and production deployment rather than ML theory.

**What you'll build:**
- Week 1: Basic autonomous agent with tool usage
- Week 2: Production-grade agent with plugins and error handling  
- Week 3: Distributed agent system with sandboxed execution
- Week 4: Full-stack agent application with API and UI
- Week 5: Scalable multi-agent platform
- Week 6: Complete AI agent framework (your own "LangChain")

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ experience
- Basic understanding of APIs and async programming
- No ML/AI knowledge required
- ~3 hours daily commitment

### Setup
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agent47

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI/Anthropic API key
```

### Your First Agent (Day 1 Preview)
```python
from agent47 import Agent, Tool

# Define a simple tool
class Calculator(Tool):
    def execute(self, expression: str) -> str:
        return str(eval(expression))  # Don't use eval in production!

# Create and run agent
agent = Agent(tools=[Calculator()])
result = agent.run("What is 25 * 4 + 10?")
print(result)  # "The answer is 110"
```
